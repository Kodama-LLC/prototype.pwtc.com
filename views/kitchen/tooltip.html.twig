<div class="docs-code-live"><p>The <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover='false' tabindex=1 title="Fancy word for a beetle.">scarabaeus</span> hung quite clear
        of any branches, and, if allowed to fall, would have fallen at our feet. Legrand immediately took
        the scythe, and cleared with it a circular space, three or four yards in diameter, just beneath the
        insect, and, having accomplished this, ordered Jupiter to let go the string and come down from the
        tree.</p></div>
